### Today's Work:

1. **[Two-Player Math Game](https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/two_player_math_game) (this exercise leverage our knowledge of OOP in ruby)**

  2. [**Active-Record  Exercises**](https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/ar-exercises)

# Instance Variables

```ruby
class Invoice
	def initialize(subtotal)
		@subtotal = subtotal # @variable_name is called instance vairable
	end
end
```

It means every invoice will have a subtotal value

In rails, @variable can be directly access by .html.erb file

# Active Record

Active record is ruby's object mapping method to perform all the actions with database
